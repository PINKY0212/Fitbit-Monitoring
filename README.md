# ⌚ Smartwatch Data Analysis using Python

A data analysis project using Python to explore and visualize smartwatch activity data.  
It uncovers patterns in health metrics like steps, heart rate, sleep, and daily activity trends.

## 📁 Project Overview

This project uses Python to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on smartwatch-generated activity data. It aims to derive insights about the user's physical activity, sleep patterns, and overall health trends through visualizations and data aggregation.

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries

- **Python 3**
- **Pandas** – data manipulation
- **NumPy** – numerical operations
- **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** – data visualization
- **Jupyter Notebook** – development environment

## 📊 Dataset Features

The smartwatch dataset typically includes the following fields:

- `Date`
- `Steps`
- `Distance`
- `Calories burned`
- `Heart rate`
- `Active minutes`
- `Sleep duration` 

## 🎯 Objectives

- Clean and preprocess the smartwatch data
- Analyze trends in:
  - Daily step count and distance
  - Heart rate patterns
  - Calorie expenditure
  - Sleep duration and quality
- Visualize key metrics over time

## 📈 Key Insights

- Activity levels vary significantly across weekdays and weekends.
- Average heart rate remains within a healthy range, with visible spikes during exercise.
- Consistent sleep patterns correlate with higher daily step counts.
